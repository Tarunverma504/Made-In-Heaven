          <p>As soon as we got engaged Jon and I started looking into wedding planners. Planning a wedding from across the world, even if it was a year away, would be far from easy. A close friend who faced a similar situation recommended Divya and Vithika and when I met Divya to discuss the plan I knew we had found a kindred soul that just got me. From then on Divya, Vithika and I started months of long distance calls, e-mails and messages planning every little detail, and we never questioned any of their ideas- they asked for a theme, a color, a muse and presented us with a design that surpassed any of my expectations.</p>

            <p>Since we were planning most of our wedding in Bangalore from afar, we wanted wedding planners that were reliable and that we could trust. We heard about Divya Vithika Wedding Planners through both searching online and through word of mouth and the praise was high. I can attest that they planned our wedding flawlessly and made it a day that we’ll never forget! Everything from ensuring that the decor looked great, to managing all of our vendors effectively and efficiently their attention to detail was superb. As a nervous bride, they took the time to make sure I felt comfortable and happy</p>

          <p>We decided to have a wedding in Bangalore to celebrate Neha & Dan’s wedding with our families back home.  Planning this wedding from afar seemed very daunting and needed someone we could trust with the entire event.  When we met Divya & Vithika, we immediately felt comfortable that they could not only manage the event but also could get our understated style.  From start to finish, it was truly a pleasure working with Divya & Vithika.  They worked extra hard to ensure that everything was just perfect, including a sleepless night before the wedding, executing on every last detail.</p>

            <p>Weddings are once-in-a-lifetime experiences, where families expect each moment to be perfect. Planning a wedding between North and South Indian families, spanning across 3 days and 3 venues was nothing short of crazy. But DivyaVithika made it a memorable event for us and all our guests. Their involvement helped us to fully enjoy every moment of the celebration without worrying about the arrangements. We had a Bollywood themed Sangeeth, a North-Indian Haldi and Mehendhi and a traditional tamil-Iyer wedding and finally a Western style Cocktail and Dinner. </p>

We consider ourselves blessed to have had the privilege of working with someone who translated our vision with such style, grace and professionalism. EVERY detail exceeded our expectations and our quests were thoroughly impressed with your talents. Not only the planning, but your coordination of all that needed to happen on the day of the wedding was much appreciated. </p>

            <p>It was an amazing experience to deal with both of you. In the beginning we were concerned since we were in USA and the wedding was going to be in Bangalore. After we made our initial contact with Divya things started happening and every thing went without a hitch. All our family and friends were thoroughly impressed with the wonderful decorations you did for the mehendi evening, wedding day and the dinner dance around the pool. You did a very professional job and we were very impressed with your eye for the finer details.</p>

          <p>Thank you so much for being there for us through the wedding planning process. Both of you are so friendly, professional, hard working & helpful. Thank you for making sure every moment of our five day wedding went so smoothly. It was so reassuring knowing you were there to make sure everything went as we had wished. No one could have done a better job! We were so lucky to have met you. We also appreciate your open-mindedness; you made every effort to learn about our culture & were very interested in our wedding customs.</p>

            <p>When I was scouting for the right wedding planner for my daughter Krutika’s wedding after researching a lot of different companies I chose to go with Divya Vithika Wedding Planners because I felt confident of their work. I liked their approach, how they always had time and were always available even when I requested last minute meetings. They looked into each and every aspect of the wedding in great detail which gave me the freedom to focus on my guests. I would like to make a special mention of their logistics and guest hospitality capabilities. </p>
